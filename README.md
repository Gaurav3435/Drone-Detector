Application for Drone Detection using Mask RCNN algorithm

Title:
A Novel Approach for Drone Intrusion Detection using Mask RCNN algorithms and Advance computer Vision
Project Description:
The main objective of the project is the detect the intrusion of manmade aerial threats. This project is developed mainly to help the military forces to detect unknown incoming threats (e.g. enemy drones, trespassing of intruders, Enemy aerial vehicles, missiles, etc.) from foreign countries. As we know, along the country border, there are places where sending soldiers can be a life threat, at such places these drones can be sent for the task accomplishment instead of the soldier itself. The drone uses onboard sensors, cameras and scans the environment and reports to the control centre if any suspicious activity is found. 

Project Details: 
Drone technology has shown to be useful in a variety of industries. The military is the most critical application a drone can undertake. Drone technology in defence can aid in the advancement of surveillance and the development of a strong defence network for the country's security. From high in the sky, the drone can keep an eye on everything! In order to safeguard the public from risks such as terrorist attacks, crowded venues must be monitored. Appropriate air support becomes a decisive advantage in this situation. Regular inspections of the installations are required to assure the supply of electricity, gas, and oil. Every second matters in search and rescue efforts. It is critical to have a quick overview of the situation, which can only be obtained from the Drone! Drones have become an integral part of armed forces around the world, serving as target decoys, combat operations, research and development, and oversight. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) will continue to be used in a variety of military operations due to their ease of use in decreasing losses and facilitating the execution of high-profile and time-sensitive missions.

The Drone Detection in our project is Done using the Mask R CNN algorithm. The Algorithm was trained over 1000 images which consist of a variety of Drone in various backgrounds and locations. The diversity in the dataset was maintained to obtain the best possible results in any situation for Drone Detection. The Algorithm was trained for 1 epoch with 10 steps per image on GPU for 1 hour. With the help of Strong GPU resources further iteration can yield better results. For evaluation the overall loss for the model was 2.389. The loss in detection of the bbox was 0.3064. The loss in class detection was 0.0068. The loss for mask detection was 0.683.
